Tired of manually replacing and exporting localized screens into devices I built this at [Huge](https://hugeinc.com) to ease production work. Great for PSD mockups.

## Download
Get the latest release [here](https://github.com/sntiagomoreno/quickfire/releases).

## Installation
- Install with [ZXP Installer](https://zxpinstaller.com/)
- Restart Photoshop.
- That's it! You should now find QuickFire under **Window** > **Extensions**.

## Keep in mind
- Source images should be the same size as the original Smart Object if you're replacing screens, for example.
- Currently document layers won't update on the `Layer to replace` dropdown. For this to happen you will need to close and reopen the extension (*needs fix*).
- Exported images filenames will match its source image name.
- Exported images with the same name will overwrite automatically.
